    <h2>Info</h2>
      <p> Cold brewing, also called cold water extraction or cold pressing,
      is the process of steeping coffee grounds in water at cool temperatures
      for an extended period. Coarse-ground beans are soaked in water for a
      prolonged period of time. The water is normally kept at room temperature,
      but chilled water is also used. The grounds are filtered out of the water
      after they have been steeped using a paper coffee filter, a fine metal
      sieve, or a French press.</p>
